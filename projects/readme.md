### Robust Single-Stage Stochastic Road Trip Optimization: Journey through Yosemite National Park
- Yosemite National Park, located in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains, is a premier destination for nature enthusiasts. We designed a three-day optimized road trip itinerary to Yosemite that balances scenic activities, meals, lodging, and fatigue. The goal was to minimize total cost and excess fatigue while maximizing experience quality, under realistic uncertainty and budget constraints. Robust optimization, and single-stage stochastic programming with uncertainties are integrated into formulating constraints for the project. Had so much fun with this!

### Delay-Aware Flight Routes Optimization & Prediction
- Inspired by the “Predict-Then-Optimize” framework, I used gradient boosting & random forest algorithms to predict delay time for each airline, destination pair, then feed it into a single-stage stochastic program we formulated to suggest the optimal route with minimal delay-to-cost ratio
