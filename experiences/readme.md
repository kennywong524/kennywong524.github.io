### Past Projects

#### LLMs & Chronology [Prof. Paul Glasserman](https://kennywong524.github.io/kennywong.github.io//#:~:text=working%20with%20Professor-,Chiwei%20Yan,-at%20the%20Department), Columbia Business School - Decisions, Risks, and Operations Division
- Selected as one of 15 interns out of 1000+ applications, I built and deployed a full experimental pipeline in Python, leveraging GPT-4.1 and other LLMs APIs to simulate
event ordering tasks and evaluate LLMs’ chronological reasoning ability at scale.
- I also developed a robust evaluation framework to compare different large reasoning models (GPT-o3, Claude Sonnet 3.7) using metrics such as Kendall’s Tau, with findings forming a basis for a potential publication.

#### Dynamic & Shared Ride Pricing & Matching under [Prof. Chiwei Yan](https://kennywong524.github.io/kennywong.github.io//#:~:text=working%20with%20Professor-,Chiwei%20Yan,-at%20the%20Department), IEOR Department, UC Berkeley College of Engineering
- I am working on developing and enhancing shared rides pricing and matching algorithms, as well as optimizing supply chain games codebase.
- Currently, exploring the effect of ridesharing platforms' features launches on drivers' propensity to 'strategize' and 'game' the system to maximize their earnings.

#### Rapid OpenStreetMap & Open Source Data under [Prof. Abhishek Nagaraj](https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/nagaraj-abhishek/), Data Innovation Lab, Haas School of Business
- Established in July 2021, [the Data Innovation Lab](https://www.abhishekn.com/about-lab) serves as an integrated environment for research in the area of innovation economics and management. We are particularly interested in understanding how we can leverage and comprehend the role of the data and AI revolution in shaping innovation, entrepreneurship and creativity at the individual, firm and societal level.

#### AI & Ethics Research under Prof. [David Evan Harris](https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/harris-david/), Haas School of Business
- I  had a privilege of collaborating one of the top 100 influential figures in AI by the [*Business Insider*](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-ai-100-2023-the-people-who-make-ai-intelligent-2023-10) to explore Generative AI & Ethics.
