I'm a junior at the [**University of California, Berkeley**](https://www.berkeley.edu/), majoring in Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR) and minoring in Data Science & Mathematics. My research integrates **Operations Research**, **Data Science**, and **Applied Economics** to improve the design and operation of complex, data-rich environments. I am broadly interested in three research areas:

- **Frontier and Limits of AI in Operations**: I investigate *the reliability of Generative AI* in high-stakes decision systems. My recent work [*(AAAI 2026)*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14214) empirically audits the limits of LLMs in chronological reasoning, identifying systematic failures in how models process time-encoded data, with implications for mitigating *lookahead bias* in forecasting tasks.

- **Revenue Management and Mechanism Design in Online Platforms**: I use optimization and machine learning to study pricing and incentive alignment in marketplaces and urban systems, with a specific focus on transportation and ride-sharing networks. My work examines how algorithmic control shapes equilibrium behavior, market outcomes, and equity.

- **Economics of Innovation and The Impact of AI**: I study human-AI Interaction to understand how emerging technologies reshape organizational behavior and workforce productivity. I advocate for a paradigm of *augmentation* rather than *automation*. Methodologically, I use online field experiments and simulation-based benchmarks to evaluate when and how AI complements human judgment.

This past summer, I was a visiting research fellow at [**Columbia Business School**](https://business.columbia.edu/), collaborating with Professor [**Paul Glasserman**](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/people/paul-glasserman) of [**Decisions, Risk, and Operations (DRO)**](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/divisions/dro). At Berkeley, I am fortunate to work with and be advised by Professor [**Chiwei Yan**](https://yanchiwei.github.io/) at the [**Department of Industrial Engineering & Operations Research**](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/), [**Berkeley College of Engineering**](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/), and Professor [**Abishek Nagaraj**](https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/nagaraj-abhishek/), at the [**Data Innovation & AI Lab**](https://thedatainnovationlab.com/), [**UC Berkeley Haas School of Business**](https://haas.berkeley.edu/).
