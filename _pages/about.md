I'm a junior at the [**University of California, Berkeley**](https://www.berkeley.edu/), majoring in Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR) and minoring in Data Science & Mathematics. I am broadly interested in data-driven and optimized decision-making under uncertainty, with applications in transportation systems, supply chains, service operations, revenue management, urban analytics, and online platforms. My research integrates theoretical methods from operations research and applied economics with empirical data science tools to understand and improve the design and operation of complex systems. I am also deeply interested in the economics of innovation, particularly in how emerging technologies—such as artificial intelligence and large language models—reshape human, organizational behavior, productivity, and societal dynamics.

This past summer, I was a visiting research fellow at [**Columbia Business School**](https://business.columbia.edu/), collaborating with Professor [**Paul Glasserman**](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/people/paul-glasserman) of [**Decisions, Risk, and Operations (DRO)**](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/divisions/dro)  to empirically investigate whether large language models (LLMs) understand chronology and sequential data. At Berkeley, I am fortunate to work with and be advised by Professor [**Chiwei Yan**](https://yanchiwei.github.io/) at the [**Department of Industrial Engineering & Operations Research**](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/), [**Berkeley College of Engineering**](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/), and Professor [**Abishek Nagaraj**](https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/nagaraj-abhishek/), at the [**Data Innovation & AI Lab**](https://thedatainnovationlab.com/), [**UC Berkeley Haas School of Business**](https://haas.berkeley.edu/).
