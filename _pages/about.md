I'm a junior at the [**University of California, Berkeley**](https://www.berkeley.edu/), majoring in Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR) and minoring in Data Science & Mathematics. I am broadly interested in data-driven and optimized decision-making under uncertainty, specifically to understand and improve the design and operation of complex systems, with areas of interest including transportation systems, service operations, revenue management, urban analytics, and online platforms. 

I am also deeply interested in the economics of innovation, particularly in how emerging technologies reshape human, organizational behavior, productivity, and societal dynamics. My work leverages online field experiments, AI and LLMs simulations, and studies of human-AI interaction to understand these evolving dynamics. Methodologically, my research combines theoretical approaches from operations research and applied economics with modern data science and machine learning tools to develop solutions for practical and policy-relevant challenges.

This past summer, I was a visiting research fellow at [**Columbia Business School**](https://business.columbia.edu/), collaborating with Professor [**Paul Glasserman**](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/people/paul-glasserman) of [**Decisions, Risk, and Operations (DRO)**](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/divisions/dro)  to empirically investigate whether large language models (LLMs) understand chronology and sequential data. At Berkeley, I am fortunate to work with and be advised by Professor [**Chiwei Yan**](https://yanchiwei.github.io/) at the [**Department of Industrial Engineering & Operations Research**](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/), [**Berkeley College of Engineering**](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/), and Professor [**Abishek Nagaraj**](https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/nagaraj-abhishek/), at the [**Data Innovation & AI Lab**](https://thedatainnovationlab.com/), [**UC Berkeley Haas School of Business**](https://haas.berkeley.edu/).
