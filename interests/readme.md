# Hobbies

Outside academics, I love teaching -- check out my [Foundations of Machine Learning (Fall 2025)](https://kennywong524.github.io/foml-fall-2025/#home) course and [others](https://kennywong524.github.io/kennywong.github.io//coursework/) I have been involved in! I'm also a big music fan; I regularly sing, play the piano and guitar with my acapella group on campus, [**Artists in Resonance (AiR)**](https://www.instagram.com/artistsinresonance/). Check out some of our performances [here](https://www.youtube.com/@ArtistsInResonance/videos?themeRefresh=1). (shameless plug :))

Being outdoor has also gradually become my pastime: hiking the [Columbia River Gorge Waterfalls](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FHQTwDUoByfMALZF_voISsyeZZgYFGMX/view?usp=sharing) in Oregon, running the [Central Park Loop](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wwBYRMOQZMrw8VbnTr5QRI58awod7uAX/view?usp=sharing) in New York, and watching the daily [California Sunset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c3r-572HvjX8nyTydSRLMGhnvlq8lkCb/view?usp=sharing) in Berkeley are some of my all-time favorites! (Follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/174517136)) 

Apart from hiking and running, I love traveling to different cities in the US and studying how they are planned through maps. I'm also a huge public transit nerd. Check out some of my travel vlogs [here](https://www.youtube.com/@kennyw589).

## 🏃‍♂️ First 10K!

I recently completed my **first-ever 10K race** at Berkeley Half Marathon 2025, which was an incredibly fun milestone in my running journey!
